Technology architecture has been centralized nowadays.

Web1 inventions like email were interoperable protocols.

Web2 inventions like short and medium size messaging have become, respectively, Twitter and Facebook (Open Metaverse, 6529.io).

Centralization of the global social and communication infrastructure in a handful of firms is unhealthy; it creates a single point of failure societally, that someday will be captured by bad actors. i.e., authorities, dictators.

While web3 would allow all the benefits of a centralized architecture, and more, because there would be more possibilities, more innovation, with not risking a dystopian, Orwellian future/outcome for society (1984 a novel - Orwell, 1949).
